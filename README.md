# Wireframing

## What is Wireframing?
Wireframing is the process of creating a simple visual guide or blueprint that represents the skeletal structure of a digital product, such as a website or mobile app. It focuses on layout, functionality, and navigation flow without getting into detailed design elements like colors, fonts, or graphics.

### Importance of Wireframing in the Design Process
- **Clarity of Ideas**: Helps stakeholders and developers understand how the system will look and function.  
- **Early Feedback**: Allows quick reviews and feedback before heavy design or coding starts.  
- **Saves Time and Cost**: Identifies potential usability issues early, reducing rework in later stages.  
- **Better Collaboration**: Serves as a communication tool between designers, developers, and stakeholders.  
- **Foundation for Prototyping**: Acts as a stepping stone toward interactive prototypes and final UI design.
